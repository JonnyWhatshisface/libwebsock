# libwebsock

This is a continuation of Payden Kyle Sutherlands original libwebsocket implementation.

Payden Sutherland passed away on September 24, 2014, mid-development of this library.
The library is almost complete, and incredibly powerful - not to mention easy to use. I
felt that picking it up and getting it finished was the right thing to do. All initial
credit belongs to him for his hard work and time put in to the project.

C library for easy WebSockets servers.

This library allows for quick and easy development of applications that use
the websocket protocol, without the need to focus on websocket protocol
specifics nor even socket specifics. It handles the sockets and the protocol
for you, allowing you to focus on the core logic of your application.

* Event Callbacks
* Support for SSL
* Extremely easy to use
* Uses [libevent][2] for maximum portability (tested on Linux, FreeBSD and Mac OS)
* Supports IPv4 and IPv6
* Passes the Autobahn Test suite
* Handles both WebSocket protocol and socket connections for you
